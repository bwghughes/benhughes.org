How many defects are there? How far through are you on the requirements analysis? How many tests have passed?

These are all questions we often get asked during status reports. We're asked to put this information into status packs. So what?

Well here's the problem. Most of these are **lagging** indicators - a term mostly used in economics. That is, they'll tell me what's happened. Here's what [Wikipedia][1] has to say about them:

> Lagging indicators are indicators that usually change after the economy as a whole does.

So, without the economic context, lagging indicators are ones that tell us about the gate, after the horse has bolted.

Inversely, and less commonly used are **leading** indicators. Here's what [Wikipedia][2] has to say about them:

> Leading indicators are indicators that usually change before the economy as a whole changes.

Again, without the economic context, these seem on the face of it much more useful.

So what does a leading indicator look like?
----



Here's some examples:

* What value have we delivered to the business already?
* How many things are we working on right now?
* How fast are we moving?
* Are we heading in the right direction?

The principle for a leading indicator is that it takes something that we know now,  and tells us where we might be going. Its a *predictive* measure. 

Lets work through the above examples one by one:

> What value have we delivered to the business already?

Since we started, what has the business seen as a retun on its investment based on the business case? For example, project controls are (sometimes) necessary (for example Project Initiation in Prince II), but have a cost to the business that doesn't (directly) benefit it. So, in essence, the faster we can deliver value to the business, the quicker we'll return to a cash neutral/profit making state (assuming that the reason for change is profit motivated).

Another way to look at this brings us nicely into point 2:

> How many things are we working on right now?

How much work in progress (WIP) do we have at the moment? If we're working on lots of things at once, we're spending a lot of time [context switching][3], and as a consequence, our flow (rate of delivery) is probably reasonably low.

> How fast are we moving?

Related to WIP - flow is about delivering valuable chunks of work. If our delivery process allows for fast flow, we can deliver business value faster.

Conclusion
-----

If we can answer these questions above, combined with out tacit knowledge and lagging indicators, we can start to predict future performance (rather than just past performance) and get better at delivering our programmes and projects.
